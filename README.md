This Project was to demonstrate and get more familiar with ASP.NET, SQL Server Management Studio, and Razor.

I only have it set to work off of local host, so if you would like to set it up to work you need to follow the database setup on the index page.

Once you get that set up you can start to play around with basic CRUD functions under the book tab in the nav bar.
